## What it does
**Theta A.I.M.** means _Theta AI Inferences Marketplace_. It's a distribution platform for developers and an AI apps marketplace for the end users.

ThetaAIM helps developers automatically distribute their AI inferences as web apps, WordPress plugins, Chrome extensions, and REST APIs to end users.

**For Developers:**
- Registers and adds TFUEL address or Bank details
- Once their AI model inference is ready and deployed on Theta EdgeCloud or AWS, they can provide an inference endpoint
- Our platform will auto-generate web apps, plugins, and APIs that can interact with inference endpoint.
- They can choose to release different type of apps
- They can set their preferred pricing

So, all they need is an AI model's inference URL. That's it. Under the hood, we've written, _custom scripts and code-generators_ to automatically build web apps, configure APIs and plugins. We also take care of payments,  infrastructure scaling, etc.

**For Users:**
- Explores various AI model offerings by categories like Web Apps, Plugins, REST APIs, etc.
- If they wish to use any specific AI model, they can purchase it's service (say REST API or Wordpress Plugin) as per their requirements
- Once they make payment to the developer's TFUEL address, our platform will automatically generate API keys or plugins, which they can then install and use.
